\title{Xylogenesis model function}

\description{
  Function that contains the xylogenesis effect of the model. \cr

  Not yet integrated into the CASSIA model. \cr

  TODO: should have a deeper explaination when it is actualy included in the model and when hte function itself is finished.
}
\arguments{
 \item{g.sD.T}{
   ??
 }
  \item{LD}{
   Daily secondary growth
 }
  \item{fD}{
   Reduction function for the daily growth.
 }
  \item{storage_reduction}{
   TRUE or FALSE . The reduction applied if there is a storage reduction.
 }
 \item{environment_effect_xylogenesis}{
   TRUE or FALSE . Determines growth considering the environmental effect or not.
   If FALSE then...
 }
 \item{Temp}{
   Temperature 'C
 }
}

\value{
  Output is in the form of a list.

  \item{cell_d_final}{
    Daily diameter, daily values. Formed by repetition of the cell diameter for early wood and late wood, for calculated number of cells.
  }
  \item{cell_wall_thickness}{

  }
  \item{ring_density}{
    Carbon density of the rings by volume. Worked out with the cumulative sum of CW at the end point divided by the last number of cells multiplied by their diameter squared.
